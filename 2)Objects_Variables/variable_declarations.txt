THERE IS SOME SYNTAX WHICH IS NEEDED TO BE FOLLOWED TO DECLARE ANY TYPE OF VARIABLE IN ANGULAR

type declaration of angular
FOUR TYPE OF DECLARATIONS 
1) declaring type and its value in one statement

	var [identifier]:[type-annotation]=value;

	example 
	var str:string='random string';

2) declare type but not with the value
	
	var [identifier]:string;
	
3) declare with value but not with the type
	
	var [identifier]=value;

4) declare with neither the value not with the type determines the any type in angular
	
	var [identifier];


// IN THE ANGULAR THERE IS ALSO THE TYPE ASSERTION

	var num=1;
	var str:string= <string><any>num;

	here we have  explicitly converted the type of num
