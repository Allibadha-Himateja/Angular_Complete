these are the thing which you must never forget when you want to achieve routing in angular

1) creating the child components is crucial like if you want to create child components

do something like this
ng g c child1
ng g c child1/child11
ng g c child1/child12
ng g c child2

2) after creating the components we need to mandatorily use the 
	<router-outlet> inside the root component else this routing wont work
	
	also import the RouterOutlet inside the ts file
3) next thing is setting the routes inside the app.routes.ts file

	the syntax for routing is important

	const routes:Routes = [
		{ path: "/",component: Child1Component,children: 
			[
			{ path:"child11",component: Child11Component }
			]
		}
		{
			path:"",
			component:Child2Component
		}
	];

4) after configuring your routes inside routes.ts you are good to go test them via hyperlinks in the template

	app.component.html

	<nav>
		a.routerLink="/" routerLinkActive="active">Child1<a>
		a.routerLink="/" routerLinkActive="active">Child1<a>
		// you know this...
	</nav>

	<router-outlet>

5) and important mention is that we need to import the 
	RouterLinks and RouterOutlets on specific and correct locations
