///

we can able to send the data via routing mechanism 
that is called passing the RouteParams

sending data in the routing via routing params 
like 
we have to set the configuration of the path inside the app.routes.ts

somthing like
const routes:Routes=[
	{ path: '\contact\:id' component:ContactComponent }
];
	
and we can just send the data like 
localhost:4200/contact/1
	
or by using the routelink

<a href="#" [routeLink]="['/contact',1]" >contact</a><br>
	

BUT WE CAN SEND BUT HOW TO RECEIVE OR ACCEPT THE PARAMS IN ROUTING 

2 ways:
	
1)
	implement the ngOnit with our component class  and also use the constructor with activatedroutes as a parameter
	id:string='';
	constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute ){}		
	// cause we are using the route object inside the ngOnit function
	inside the 
	ngOnit():void
	{
			this.id= this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
	}

	
2) or by observables in js
	subscribing to the paramMap Observable
	that is similar to of this but all we have  to do is we have to subscribe to the paramMap

	this.route.paramMap.subscribe((params:ParamMap)=>
	{
		this.id=params.get("id");
	});
		
	since it does not have a complete method 
	the observer can and will able to listen to this observable all the time 
	i think we just have implemented the next method for subscribing to the paramMap method
