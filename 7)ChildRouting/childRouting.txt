Child Routing is an Extention of Routing in Angular

it is also called the nested Routing
the question was to implement the child routing on 

-MenuComponent(base component)
	-ProductComponent
		-new Component
		-edit Component
	-CustomerComponent

the childrouting is focussed on routing in general

assuming that we are taking three components

-balance component
-withdraw 
-deposit
	-deposit A
	-deposit B
inside deposit we are having two child components


steps 
we have to manually create all these components
balance component
withdraw component
deposit component
deposita component
depositb component



the routing will be done is 
export const routes: Routes = [
    {path:'home',component:AppComponent},
    {path:'balance',component:BalanceComponent},
    {path:'withdraw',component:WithdrawComponent},
    {path:'deposit',component:DepositComponent,children:
        [
            {path:'coins',component:DepositAComponent},
            {path:'notes',component:DepositBComponent},
        ]
    }
];

and in the deposit component
in ts file
import { RouterLink, RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';

inside the view
<br>
<a routerLink="coins">For_Coins</a><br>
<a routerLink="notes">For_Notes</a>
