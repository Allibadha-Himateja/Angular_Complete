what is httpclient

the httpclient is an object which is used for http(hypertext trafer protocol)
communication , allowing the applications to interact with the webapi's or websites

we can able to use the methods 
get,post,put,delete....

ACTUALLY THIS SPECIFIC TOPIC IS RELATED TO JAVASCRIPT TOPICS LIKE
-fetchapi
-xmlhttprequest 
in js

for we able to communicate with the backend api's from the angular application
we have to use this httpclient ...

/// PROCEDURE TO IMPLEMENT THE HTTPCLIENT

we have to make use of the ngOnInit() overload in order to use the httpclient object
but before that we have to get the instance for this httpclient from the
DEPENDENCY INJECTION through constructor

export class AppComponent
{
	constructor(private http:HttpClient)
	{}

	ngOnInit():void
	{
		this.http.get("url").subscribe(
			data=>console.log(data);
		)
		// .get method is not for posting the data from the app to server
		// and in .get method we can able to pass the query params via url
		// http://localhost:7094/api/product?id:20

	}
}

/// the subscirbe is for handling the response back from the server 
we have to understand a topic called observables in js to better understanding of
how the .subscribe method works.....

///
 MOST CRUCIAL STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE HTTPCLIENT 

 1)importing the httpclient in the component as usual
 2) importing the HttpModule inside the app.config.ts or module file
