THIS IS THE INTRODUCTION TO ANGULAR

ANGULAR IS A FRONTEND FRAMEWORK WHICH IS USED TO BUILD THE RESPONSIVE APPLICATION
THIS IS BUILD BY GOOGLE

// LETS JUMP INTO INSTALLTION OF ANGULAR INTO YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM

-- FIRST THIS IS ANGULAR APPLICATION ARE HANDLED ON TOP OF ANGULAR CLI(COMMAND LINE INTERFACE)
SO WE NEED TO INSTALL THE ANGULAR CLI IN ORDER TO BUILD THE ANGULAR APPLICATIONS

-- installation of angular/cli
-- open command prompt in your local system and enter this
>npm i -g angular/cli

-- after completion of installation for verfiying the installation enter
> ng --version

/// this is the end of installation of angular in your local system

// NOW WE WILL CREATE First angular application with below commands

--ng new "app-name" 
	ng new "first-app" ,click enter

	>> this will display few options for you to choose
	which stylesheet format would you like to use??
	>> CSS 
	>> Sass (SCSS)
	>> Sass (Indented)
	>> Less 

	we will discuss about them very shortly

--choose the CSS ,click enter
	>> another Question is asked 
	>> Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)?(y/N)

-- enter N,click enter
	>> THE INSTALLATION OF ALL THE default packages and angular libraries are installed into your first application


before getting in depth for undertanding the architecture we should understand the options which the angular cli have provided us before creation of the application

QUESTION 1)
 which stylesheet format would you like to use??
 >> CSS (cascading style sheet) like for .css file
 >> Sass (SCSS)  it is a modern version of Stylesheet .scss
	the syntax for styling is modern and new 
 >> Sass (Indented) this is another kind of stylesheet version .sass
	not that modern 
 >> Less another kind .....


 QUESTION 2) 
 Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)?

 what is server-side rendering 
	the server node.js prerenders the html before sending it to browser
	after loading the angular takes over(hydration) and makes the app interactive

	used when we need fast reloads 
	blogs,documentation,portfolios...

 what is Static site generation?
	at build time (ng build) angular generates the static html file for specific routes..

basically if you reaally need anything related to prerendering and prebuilding then you can go with yes....

/// THAT WAS THE END OF CREATING ANGULAR APPLICATION....
