HOW CAN WE ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO COMPONENTS 
WHICH ARE INSIDE THE ROOT COMPONENT?

how can we able to pass the values form one component to other component ..
is what component communication means...

/// 

what we are assuming is
	->app component(base)
		-> first component(parent)
			->second component(child inside the first component)

///

how to pass the params from parent to child and child to parent
SOLUTION IS @Input and @Output Directives in Angular...
DIRECTIVES....
@Input lets the parent component update data inside the child component 
@Output lets the child component send data to the parent component

1)@Input()

	let me make it clear for you
	this @Input directives is used for sending the data from the parent component
	to the child component
	
	firstcomponent to second component

	--Process 

		we have to declare the variable/object via @Input Directive inside the child component
		that is we have to
		
		1)
			declare a variable inside the SecondComponent.ts with @Input Directive
			import { Input } from '@angular/core';
			export class SecondComponent
			{
				@Input fparent:string ="";
			}

		2) 
			we have to use this @Input Directive from the parent component's 
			template

			THERE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW A SPECIFIC SYNTAX FOR ACHEIIVING THAT

			the data from the parent component to the child component is sent
			via child selector
			and using the input directive fron inside the child selector

			<app-second [second_component_variable]='first_component_variable' ></app-second>

			which means we are already having a twowaybinded variable which if of first-component's
			like 
			export class FirstComponent
			{
				fmsg:string="";
			}
			//template

			<input type='text' [(ngModel)]='fmsg' />
